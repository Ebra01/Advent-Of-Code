# Advent Of Code (Using Rust Programming Language)

#### I'm currently in the process of learning Rust, and I decided to use [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) as a platform to advance my problem-solving skills with Rust.

### Progress:

* [2023/Day 1 Part 1](2023/aoc-d1-p1/src/main)
* [2023/Day 1 Part 2](2023/aoc-d1-p2/src/main)
* [2023/Day 2 Part 1](2023/aoc-d2-p1/src/main)
* [2023/Day 2 Part 2](2023/aoc-d2-p2/src/main)
* [2023/Day 3 Part 1](2023/aoc-d3-p1/src/main)
	* I wouldn't say I like this one, the solution contains a lot of code duplication, and there are better ways to solve it. But this is good for now!
* [2023/Day 3 Part 2](2023/aoc-d3-p2/src/main)
	* Similar issues with D3P1.
* [2023/Day 4 Part 1](2023/aoc-d4-p1/src/main)
* [2023/Day 4 Part 2](2023/aoc-d4-p2/src/main)
* [2023/Day 5 Part 1](2023/aoc-d5-p1/src/main)
